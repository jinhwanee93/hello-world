Learning how to create a new repository

I have no idea what i'm doing, but i get this whole Git thing... I'm assuming this is who "game developers" patch their games, by using a "feature" branch to do work, and then finalizing their changes into the actual game (aka. "master" branch). Pretty cool!!!
